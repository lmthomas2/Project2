<h1>Tech Hero</h1>
<p>Project 2 Requirement: A 'tech hero'.  A short bio and links to someone who is challenging norms within the tech space. It should be a person of color or ally who is providing leadership in advancing equity for race/class/gender in the United States. No CEOs from Google or Microsoft here; We've all heard of Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, and the other "Hidden Figures." â€” Find someone you know personally, or stretch yourself and profile someone who others are unlikely to know because they're not in the news everyday. Need some ideas? Go to peopleofcolorintech.comLinks to an external site.. (500 word max profile with useful links).</p>
