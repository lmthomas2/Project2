<p>Hello everyone! I have been an educator in the classroom and an online instructor for over 20 years. I have taught Data Policy and Governance, Foundations of Data Studies, Data Archives, Data Curation and Management, Cultural Anthropology, Art History, Art Appreciation as well as many Business courses. I have a Master of Library and Information Science from IU Indianapolis, a Master of Arts in Computing in Education from Columbia University in the city of New York, a Master of Fine Arts from Academy of Art University, a Master of Business Administration from Indiana Wesleyan University, a Master of Arts in Medical Anthropology from Creighton University, and a Master of Arts in Classical Studies from Villanova University.
<p>When I am not teaching I enjoy traveling, riding my bike, baking, reading, learning about different cultures, and creating artwork.</p>
